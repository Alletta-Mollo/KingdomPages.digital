December was usually an extremely busy month for most event planners, and this December was no exception for Debbie’s company.

It was Tuesday afternoon and she’d already had four appointments. She was on her fifth appointment, which had been going for almost an hour. She could hardly wait for the day to end.

“…Please, Sir, Ma’am, I’m going to hand you a document I made based on today’s meeting. I would like you to take your time, go through the list, and come to an agreement on what you want for your big day. Then, at our next appointment, we can move forward with the next steps…”

It wasn’t that she was complaining — the more jobs they got, the more money and referrals came in. That being said, it was tiring having to deal with couples like the one she was currently with: the type who never seemed to agree on anything, even a detail as small as what kind of water would be served on their wedding day!

The moment she ushered them out of her office she quickly began packing her things, not wanting to get home too late. That’s when she saw the missed calls — five from her son’s school and an additional seven from her husband: thirteen missed calls in total!!!

She always put her phone on silent when in a meeting, but she had checked it before the last appointment and there hadn’t been any calls. The missed calls from her son’s school and her husband could only mean one thing…there was a problem, and it had to do with her son.

She called her husband immediately. “Honey, is Sean okay? I just saw your calls — my phone was on silent. What happened to Sean? Where is he?” she blurted, questions tumbling out one after the other, unable to control the anxious feelings swirling within her.

“Babe, please calm down. Come to the hospital; Sean is not too good. I will give you the details when you get here,” he said, sounding distressed.

“Is my son alive?” she asked, needing to know right away.

“Yes, babe, he is. Please calm down. Order an Uber if you don’t think you can drive…I can only handle one emergency in a day,” her husband replied.

“I can drive and I’m coming right away.” She absolutely couldn’t fathom waiting for an Uber, given the circumstances.

As she drove to the hospital — a journey that seemed to take forever although it was really only ten minutes — her mind kept flashing graphic images of all the possible scenarios that could have led Sean to be hospitalized. At the same time she forced herself to speak in the unknown tongues (the language often used by the Sealed). Even if she didn’t know what was going on, her spirit was communicating with the Spirit who knows all things.

On arriving at the children’s section of the hospital, she saw her husband sitting on one of the corridor benches with his head bent. She called out to him and he hurried to her, enveloping her in a warm embrace.

There could have been a thousand other people in that waiting room, but all she could think was: Where is my son and what happened to him?

“Honey, where’s my baby? What happened to him?” she asked, voicing the thoughts swirling through her mind as she backed out of his embrace.

“He’s in the emergency ward, babe. The doctors are attending to him. His teacher called me from school. Apparently, during recess he said he wanted to drink some water and, while going to get his bottle, he suddenly collapsed. They called the ambulance to bring him here and started trying to reach you and me.”

“So what are the doctors saying?” she asked, still feeling like she didn’t have the answers she needed.

Her husband looked utterly helpless, unsure of what to say, since he also hadn’t gotten much from the doctors when he arrived.

“All I know is that he’s been connected to an oxygen tank,” he said, trying to reassure her as best he could. “I’m hoping one of them will come out soon to give us more information.” He took her hands in his and tried to soothe her.

Just then, one of the doctors came out.

“Doctor, please — what’s wrong with our boy? Is he okay?” they both spoke at the same time.

“Could you kindly come to my office so we can have a private conversation?” the doctor replied.

The moment they took their seats, he went straight to business. “As I told you earlier, Mr. Lewis, your son has been connected to an oxygen tank. He was in a very critical state when he arrived, but we’ve been able to stabilize him. We've taken his blood sample for some tests and we’re waiting for the results, but from the preliminary examinations carried out so far, I think your son has a blood disorder…”

“MY SON DOES NOT HAVE A BLOOD DISORDER,” Debbie replied reflexively.

“Please calm down, ma’am,” the doctor admonished. “I can understand you are a bit hysterical at this time…”

“I’m not hysterical — I’m only telling you my son does not have a blood disorder,” she replied.

“Babe, please don’t interrupt the doctor. Sorry, Doctor, you can continue,” her husband said.

The scrape of the doctor’s chair as he stood up jolted Debbie back to the present; she hadn’t realized her mind had wandered.

“Please, can we see our son?” Debbie’s husband asked.

“He’s been taken to a private room so you can be with him, even though he’s sleeping at the moment. The nurse at reception will direct you.”

Debbie hurried into the room as soon as the nurse led them there and paused at the edge of the bed. Her three-year-old son, usually vibrant and bouncing with energy, was connected to an oxygen tank, absolutely still and much too pale for her liking.

She didn’t realize tears were rolling down her cheeks until her husband stood beside her, wiping them away.

“…that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh…”

Debbie turned sharply to her husband. “What did you say?”

“I didn’t say anything. What did you hear?”

“…Didn’t you say something about life just now?”

“Babe, I haven't said anything. Maybe it’s coming from the corridor.”

“…that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh…” she heard the words again, soft but clear. Suddenly, energy surged through her. She knew where those words were coming from, and light shone in her mind on what she should do.

Immediately she touched Sean’s hands and legs and began speaking in the unknown tongues.

“Babe, what are you doing?” her husband asked.

“I’m doing something about Sean’s blood,” she replied.

“I don’t have an issue with you praying, but you are talking gibberish. You’re literally not making sense with your words.”

“Honey, don’t worry. The one I’m talking to understands. Could you please just give me a moment with Sean…”

“Okay…let me go get some coffee, but please take it easy and know we’re in this together,” he said before stepping out of the room.

She could see the weight on his shoulders and the concern in his eyes — a few moments ago she had been feeling the same way. But now she knew exactly what to do.

As soon as he shut the door, Debbie proceeded to speak in the unknown tongues as she carefully placed her hands on one of Sean’s legs and his hand.

As she spoke more in the unknown tongues, words from the Sealed Manual that she had spent all these years reading and meditating on began leaping out of her mouth and she personalized them.

“…that Spirit that raised Christ from the dead lives in you, Sean, and therefore quickens your body.”

“…Sean, the Spirit of God has made you, and the breath of the Almighty has given you life…”

Debbie continued like this until the nurses came and asked her to vacate the room so they could attend to Sean.

The next day

Debbie and her husband were back in the doctor’s office. The atmosphere was tense, but Debbie remained quietly assured.

“Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Donwell… The test results are out and, like I said yesterday, it’s been confirmed that your son has a blood disorder and it’s a chronic one. The good news is that it can be managed. Many people live with this condition. With the proper medication, most are able to live normal lives well into old age.” He paused as if expecting some reaction from Debbie based on her response the day before, but she remained calm, only moving to take her husband’s hand in hers.

So the doctor continued, “We’ve already taken him off the oxygen tank since his breathing has been stabilized. However, we still need to observe him and then determine his treatment plan… Do you have any questions before I continue?”

“Yes please, Doctor. Could you conduct another test on my son? Like I said yesterday, his blood is okay,” Debbie stated, the stoic expression on her face brooking no argument.

“Babe… I thought we’d gone through this yesterday…” her husband tried to reason with her.

“Please, honey, I know, but can he indulge me? Doctor, before you administer any treatment on my son, I am asking you to please take another blood sample and do the test again.”

“Mrs. Donwell, our lab is the best in the state and I can assure you we have a 100% test accuracy rate, but if you insist we can indulge you, although the earlier we start administering treatment the better his chances of resuming his normal life.”

“Please, indulge me,” she replied.

She could tell her husband was bewildered by her insistence, but she had made up her mind to fight for her son and he would eventually understand. The doctor dismissed them from his office and asked them to wait while tests were being run on their son.

The moment they stepped out of the office, she could sense her husband’s frustration.

“Babe, I'm not pleased with what you did in the doctor’s office. I know you became a member of an association or whatever you call it some time back. I don’t have a problem with it, but right now our son’s life is at stake. You can’t be taking risks based on what some brainwashed philosopher told you or wrote in a manual. Let’s be logical in our approach and face facts; the earlier we let the doctor who has medical experience of over thirty years do his work on our son, the better for us,” he stated matter-of-factly.

“Honey, I’m focusing on Truth right now, not facts,” she tried to explain. “Sean’s blood is perfectly fine, and when the doctors check him again they are going to see it. One more test isn’t going to hurt anyone; in fact, we could ask them to expedite it.”

Her husband was still looking at her like maybe she had lost her mind. But making him understand was not her priority at the moment. She left him in the hallway and headed to Sean’s room to do what she had been doing every moment she had the chance.

With her hands placed on his head and chest, she spoke in unknown tongues and quoted words from the manual of the Sealed Ones. “Sean, your body is the temple of God; Christ lives in you, so the life you have now, you live by the faith of the Son of God.”

The next day

Debbie sat in a chair next to her son’s hospital bed and made him repeat some of the things she had been saying from the manual. He had finally woken up in the early hours of the morning when she arrived to continue her sessions with him. She couldn’t wait to hear the result of the second test.

Soon after, her husband and the doctor came into the room with puzzled looks on their faces.

“Is everything okay?” Debbie asked, rising from her seat and taking Sean’s hand in hers.

“There’s been a kind of inconsistency with the second test result and I’m wondering where it came from,” the doctor replied.

“What did you see?” Debbie calmly asked.

“It shows his blood is clean and healthy, without any trace of a disorder.”

“Oh! I told you my son was okay,” she exclaimed, her joy lighting up the entire room as she peppered kisses on her son’s forehead. “Sean, my darling, you are perfect — every single bit of you, my beautiful boy! I just knew it!”

“I’m very sorry for the inconvenience, but do you mind if we do another test on him because this is not normal? We won’t expedite it this time; we want to be sure a thorough job is done.”

Debbie looked at her husband, who had been silent, and replied to the doctor, “Yes, if you wish, but the result will still show what you just saw.”

The next day

The doctor entered the room to discuss matters with Debbie and her husband, who were playing with a very energetic Sean.

“I really don’t know how to explain it, and I can't even tell at what point it changed… I know when your son was brought into the hospital he showed all the symptoms of this condition and the first test result confirmed it, but right now the second and third results are showing an entirely different outcome, and even your son is looking so healthy and acting like someone who was never sick… his discharge papers have been written.”

Debbie jumped and hugged her husband, awash with feelings of joy.

“Thank you, Doctor,” her husband replied.

As soon as the doctor left, Lewis quickly grabbed Debbie’s hands and said, “I know you had something to do with this. Does this have to do with all that sealed jargon you are always going on about?”

She laughed. “…Yes, dear, it has everything to do with the Sealed, and no, it’s not jargon.”

“Whatever it is, I'm now officially one of your converts. Tell me everything about it.”
