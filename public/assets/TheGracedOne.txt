As a child, Mitchell had always known that she was special and different from other kids. Growing up, she always had things handed to her so easily even when she didn't ask for it. She was what you would call, a favoured child. This was because of her upbringing as a child. She was always taught to stay in the word and take advantage of the grace that the word brings. She applied this life hack throughout her childhood up to her adulthood so it was no surprise that she always got promoted at work at every turn even before some of the 'professionals'. Not only was she favoured, she also excelled in whatever she did, so no one ever came out to complain about favouritism, however she was envied. Grace had been bestowed on her, so her life was always from one level of glory to another.
During a conversation with one of her friends, the question of how she advances so quickly came up and she replied ' It's Grace. I am full of grace heaped upon grace and I don't receive the grace of God in vain, rather, I recognize, celebrate and use grace.'
That friend asked baffled, "How do you recognize and use grace?"
"You recognize grace by putting yourself in the atmosphere of the word and acknowledging that the word brings grace. This is because the ministry of the word causes grace to increase in your life. Then you use grace by acting on the word" She explained with a kind smile.
"Please enlighten me" Her friend said curiously.
Mitchell beamed "God gives you grace to accomplish anything and then when you accomplish it, He gives you more grace to do more. Grace singles a person out and there is always something about a man or woman with grace that attracts people to him or her."
Her friend laughed "That's just like you. Everyone wants to be associated with you."
Mitchell grinned "That is what grace can do in your life. It gives you the advantage and you always need to be conscious of it. Grace also beautifies and no one should ever attempt to work against a person with grace because it would mean that such person is trying to fight against the source of grace, which is God. Simply put, grace means to walk in divine influence; it makes you have the mentality of 'I will get anything, if I want it'. It also delivers favor and joy to a person."
"I'm astonished, how do I receive this grace in my life?"
"The more you know the Lord, the more grace you stand to enjoy in your life. The more you fill your heart with God’s Word and have the Holy Spirit work in your life, the greater the grace of God that’ll be manifested in your life. So, you have to know the Lord for yourself and the first step in doing that, is to give your life to Jesus.”
Right where she was, the friend knelt down and said "I'm ready. I want to live for the Lord and use this grace to accomplish great things for Him."
Mitchell led her to Christ and got her filled with the Holy Sprit. Since that day, Avery, her friend became different and talked differently because she knew the life she was living and the grace that was upon her life.
