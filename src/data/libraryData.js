For I will cause the ground beneath them to shake and there shall be an awakening. And the light that shone before their eyes and couldn’t open it will shine within them and there will be no escaping it. And their eyes will be open wide and will not be shut to sleep ever again.”\nThen I fell on my knees before the One Who spoke to perform it as He had spoken\nAnd my heart was at peace";
