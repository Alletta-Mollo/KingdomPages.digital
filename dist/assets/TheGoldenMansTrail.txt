“…Thank you, dear people of Smyrna,” I say, closing off yet another very well-attended election rally.


Loud applause and cheers follow as I wave goodbye to the people. I am continually overwhelmed with gratitude by the great show of support for my campaign to be the next Governor of Smyrna.


“Congratulations, Sir. The votes of the people belong to you,” my trusted Executive Assistant, Linda, comments as I step into our makeshift office.


“Great job, Mr. Andrew—or should I say Governor Andrew…” Bob, who’s been my campaign manager from the beginning, grips my hand in a firm shake. Everyone in the room is in high spirits.


Aside from the large crowds that have attended all our rallies in the last couple of months, the stats and all the analysis point to the fact that our work here will not be in vain. I am far ahead of all my opponents in the voter polls. In fact, I recently heard I’ve been nicknamed *The Golden Man* by the media.


My eyes scan the room, meeting the eyes of every single member of the team. I know how hard they’ve worked to get us to this point. I hope they can feel how much I appreciate their efforts. I am trusting that in a couple of months, we will get to celebrate the fruits of our labor. We just need to shore up our position and keep pressing our advantage for the next eight weeks. It’s time to seal the deal.



**One week later**


It’s 6 a.m. My wife and I wake up to all our phones ringing incessantly. The noise cuts through the fog of sleep, and almost immediately, we are both wide awake. Our eyes connect, communicating silently, minds racing to our teenage daughter who is at school in a different city.


In a split second, we each reach for the nearest phone. The call is not what I expected—thankfully—but the news I’m getting is not any less catastrophic. I hurriedly grab the TV remote, switching it on, and right there on the screen is breaking news that could potentially cost me all my life’s work.


“What in the world are you talking about…?” I hear my wife exclaim in the background.


The entire room fades away as I stare at the TV screen, watching the whole debacle unfold. It feels like watching an atomic bomb detonate on all our hopes for the future. I can’t watch any longer or I may not be able to prevent the mental breakdown trying to engulf my mind. I head to the study, where I’ve spent many sleepless nights and early mornings toiling away at making our dreams a reality—dreams that now seem virtually impossible.


I lock the door behind me, but I can’t stop seeing the images from the news headline. *“THE GOLDEN MAN EMBROILED IN SCANDAL!”* keeps flashing in my mind. Everything we worked for, all the investment, down the drain because of an incident that took place twenty-five years ago.


My mind travels back to that fateful day—the day my friend and I were caught in the act of stealing a prized painting.


I was born without a silver spoon, raised in a tardy neighborhood. We barely had a proper meal to eat in a day. With two younger siblings and a sick single mother who tried to get cleaning jobs to make money, I got sucked in by the bad crowd. They taught me to pick pockets to make ends meet.


I knew it was wrong, but with my dad gone, I felt responsible as the eldest son. I couldn’t bear to see my siblings hungry or my mum cry every night because she was too weak to get a proper job.


This is the exact kind of situation I was hoping to prevent as the new Governor of Smyrna. How ironic that the same incident that made me vow to be an agent of change in my community would cost me the opportunity to do so.


I remember the day the new kid, Jimmy, showed up on our block. He bragged about how experienced he was—not just at picking pockets, but stealing larger and more expensive items. It wasn’t long before he goaded us into going for bigger steals. He convinced us that we could cart away one of the principal’s prized paintings worth thousands of dollars. We were frightened and reluctant, but the desire to impress Jimmy was compelling.


On the day of the stint, I tried so hard to come up with a thousand and one excuses not to join the squad, but none of my attempts were successful. Eventually, I gave up and joined them.


It didn’t take much. With Jimmy’s superior skills, we successfully broke into the principal’s house and picked up the painting. On our way out, something else caught Jimmy’s attention. As he went in for a closer look, an alarm was triggered. We scurried out of the house trying to escape, but unfortunately one of my friends sprained his leg while jumping from the window. I ran back to help him while the others fled, and that’s how we got caught by the principal’s housekeeper, who called the police.


Interestingly, it was discovered that “Jimmy”—whose name was not even Jimmy—was a notorious thief in the city he previously resided in and was actually on the run from the cops. Thankfully, I was young enough not to get sent to prison. The judge was compassionate, and I got away with community service and mandatory counseling.


I thought I had paid dearly for that act through the punishment that was given. In addition, I had a permanent mark on my record that stopped me from getting my top picks for university. Yet here I am, years later, paying the ultimate price for my sins.



**Hours later**


Loud banging on the door brings me out of the loop my brain has been stuck in. I can’t tell how many hours it’s been, only that the sun is no longer high in the sky, and it was just rising when I set foot in here and locked the door behind me. I can only imagine what Gracie has had to deal with all day. I have been recounting every single detail, rehashing every decision and circumstance that led to this moment. I don’t really know what to say or how to face everyone.


“Honey, are you alright? It’s been hours,” Gracie calls at the door. “I’ve tried to give you space, but if you don’t say anything, I’m going to have to call someone to break the door down. I need to know if you are okay.” I can hear the deep concern in her voice.


I have to get it together. I need to face Gracie, and I need to speak to the team.


“I’m coming, honey,” I respond as I go to unlock the door. The moment the door opens, Gracie wraps her arms around me, and the emotions I’ve been holding back come rushing out.



**Two weeks later**


It’s getting closer to the elections, and the media is in a frenzy. With all the negative press around the scandal, the other aspirants have suddenly come up in the polls. The people of Smyrna are divided into so many camps. It’s almost hard to imagine that a few weeks ago, I was *The Golden Man*.


I’m in a meeting with my campaign team, and it’s been going on for hours—just like the one we had yesterday, the day before, and every day since the scandal erupted. I honestly don’t know what other strategies we can implement.


We tried a public apology, to show the people how remorseful I am for my actions all those years ago. We tried a press conference where I answered all the media questions to help people understand the difficulty of my circumstances back then. I’ve even resorted to carrying out humanitarian activities, intentionally reported to the media. Nothing has made a difference. I’m not even among the top three aspirants. Every time an update comes in, my heart races hoping for some good news, but it’s been back-to-back bad news.


I made up my mind this morning that if we couldn’t come up with a viable solution today, then I would have to consider calling it quits. We’ve been at it for hours, and all evidence points to the same conclusion: there is absolutely no way my campaign will be able to recover from the scandal. I guess it’s time to make one of the toughest announcements I’ve ever had to make.


“Ladies and gentlemen, can I have everyone’s attention…” I call out, drawing the room silent. I take a bracing breath, gathering my strength as the atmosphere becomes completely solemn.


“First off, I want to say, you are the most amazing team. You have put your all into this campaign, and I am eternally grateful for every single one of you.


“Once again, I am so sorry that you had to go through the fiasco of these past two weeks. It was my actions that brought scandal to this campaign, and for that I am deeply sorry. I can’t tell you in words how much I wish I could go back in time and reverse what happened. Regardless, no amount of wishing can make that happen, and that leads me to my final announcement.


“You all stood by me in the last two weeks. We tried every strategy in the book, and I am so grateful. But at some point, I have to evaluate if all the sacrifice is worth it. I strongly believe that the best course of action now would be to drop out of the race and cut our losses. I will give my final decision tomorrow. Thank you all.”


Without lingering to see their responses, I pick up my briefcase and head out to the parking lot. I can’t bear to see the disappointment on their faces.



**Later that day**


“Honey, you need to eat your food. You’ve barely eaten well in weeks.” Gracie looks at me with the concern I’ve seen on her face more times than I can count in the past two weeks.


She hasn’t said much, but I know this whole thing must be taking a toll on her. We’ve worked towards this vision meticulously since we got engaged all those years ago. I’ve been postponing the conversation about my decision to drop out of the race, but now I have to tell her. I reach out to hold her two hands in mine.


“Babe, I need to tell you something… Thank you so much for standing by me all these years. I may not say it enough, but you have been the most amazing wife—helping me and supporting this vision all these years. I know how much you’ve put in, and it means so much to me. Even these past two weeks, you’ve been such an encouragement to me, so thank you from the bottom of my heart.”


At this point, I can barely restrain my emotions, but I have to soldier on. “I think that, with everything that’s happened, the right thing for me to do is to step down.”


The shock on her face is undeniable.


“Okay, honey, hear me out…” I try to reassure her.


I can see she’s got that determined glint in her eyes—the one that means she is not going to go down without a fight. So I nod for her to voice her thoughts.


“I felt you needed your space,” she says, “…and I’ve let you be for a while. But I think it’s high time I speak frankly, because there’s something you’ve not taken into consideration.”


“Okay… what’s that?” I reply, feeling a little baffled that she thinks I haven’t explored every possible option. I would never give up on our dream without considering every avenue out of this mess.


“You are among the Sealed Ones, Andrew.”


“Yeah… I know I’m a Sealed One, but what’s that got to do with this?” I’m honestly perplexed.


“You committed this crime before you became a Sealed One. And our manual says that when you become a Sealed One, you are a new creature—old things are passed away, and all things have become new. He loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood.”


“Yeah, I know God has forgiven me, but this is about the people.”


“You need to talk to the Master and take advantage of His grace,” she continues. “If you read the Manual, you will see several people in our lineage who did terrible things—some worse than what you did, if we want to compare. Like Jacob, David, and even Paul. By God’s grace, they ended up as great men, fulfilling their God-given purpose. So there’s absolutely no situation beyond God’s grace and restoration. Your case will not be different.”


Suddenly, a light bulb turns on in my mind, and I realize she’s right. I have been going about this all wrong. I have been allowing the old guilt and shame from the past to condemn me, when in reality, my status as a Sealed One rids me of every mistake of the past.


“Thank you so much, babe. I never saw it in this light. I will go right away to study the Manual and then have a talk with the Master.”


Hours later, I am on the floor of the study in a kneeling position, head bowed down. I speak in unknown tongues and then utter some words in English as I am inspired: “All things work together for my good… Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof…” The more I speak, the greater my conviction that things are turning around and my victory is sure.


**The next day**


The team is seated in the boardroom, and they all rise to greet me as soon as I walk in. The atmosphere is tense, following yesterday’s announcement.


“Good morning, everyone,” I greet with my brightest smile.


Some of the faces in the room are obviously surprised by my jovial mood. I can imagine they must be shocked by the complete 180. After my prayer session yesterday, I was flooded with the kind of peace that only the Master gives.


Not wanting to waste any more time, I begin the meeting. “Ladies and gentlemen, today is a new day for us. I’m not stepping down, and there’s going to be a turnaround of events.”


One of the maintenance staff knocks on the door and enters without waiting for my response.


“Sorry to interrupt, Sir, but a call was made that we should watch the TV right now. Apparently, there’s a large group of people rallying on the streets. They are stating that you were underaged when you committed the crime. Moreover, you served the punishment. They said you’ve helped several young people from the city since then. And guess who is leading the group—the principal himself!”


Another staff member walks in. “Sir, there’s a young man on another station being interviewed. He says he was a street kid that was into crime, but through your influence he became clean, and now he’s a doctor…”


**One month later**


“…With great pleasure, would you rise as we welcome the Executive Governor of Smyrna—our *Golden Man*—His Excellency Governor Andrew and his lovely wife to the podium…”
