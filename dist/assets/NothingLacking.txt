**Vee**

“…so everyone, listen up,” my manager announces. “This is unexpected and the time frame is short, but we all have to make our contributions. Assistant Managers and below, \$200; Managers upward, \$700.”

“See ehn…” my colleague whispers to me.

I can hear him speaking, but honestly, I’m not really listening. This announcement is quite unexpected, and knowing the amount in my bank account, it’s looking pretty impossible at the moment.

“…Vee, are you even listening to me?” he whispers.

Moments later, after the meeting.

My mobile phone rings, and I immediately pick it up without looking at the caller ID.

“Hello.”

“Good afternoon, Ma. I trust you are having a great day. I’m calling to remind you of the commitment you made to The Messenger Angel Book. We need to produce several copies to send to the different communities. We are therefore counting on you to do something before the week runs out. God bless you, Ma.”

“Thank you for the reminder,” I reply, trying to insert some cheer into my voice.

**3 Hours Later**

I’m driving into my estate, super glad to finally be heading home after a long day. I can’t wait to put my feet up and watch something nice. Just take a break from everything.

Just as I pull up to the gate, a super happy greeting draws me out of my reverie. It’s Charles, our trusty security man. He’s always cheerful and super helpful. I can’t even count the number of times he has gone out of his way to make my life easier. Most times, he does it without me asking.

“Aunty, welcome Ma. How was your day, Ma?” he greets, speaking in Nigerian pidgin English.

“It was fine, Charles, thank you.”

I’m honestly not in the mood for small talk, but I don’t want to be rude to Charles.

Oblivious to my state of mind, Charles forges ahead.

“Aunty, e be like say you get early appointment this morning, because as I say make I bring soap come wash your car, you don already dey commot. But tomorrow I go wake up early, come wash your car sharp sharp.” He smiles.

“Oh, that’s kind of you. Yes, I was in a hurry; someone was waiting for me. But thank you all the same.”

I’m really trying to keep a kind look on my face, although all I want is to be in the sanctuary of my house.

I walk along the side of my car to the back seat, grabbing my bags in hopes of a quick escape.

I head towards my apartment, only to realise that Charles is already lingering at my entrance with a hopeful expression.

“Okay, Ma…ermmm Auntie…e get something wey I wan ask you.”

“What is it, Charles? I hope all is well.”

“Auntie, all is well o…na my pikin call me say she need money to buy JAMB form, and the registration dey end tomorrow. You know say I spend all the money wey I get when I go bury my brother last month. Abeg, if you fit just help me.”

He kneels down, really pleading with me. How can I refuse to help him? I mean, it’s Charles. I know he’s not trying to take advantage of me. He’s not that type of person.

“You know say na only you I fit beg for inside this estate,” he pleads sincerely.

“It’s okay, Charles. Please get up, you don’t have to do all this. Just send me the account details, okay?”

Immediately, he leaps up. “Haaaaa, Aunty, God go bless you, God go prosper you…” He proceeds to utter several blessings.

“Amen, Charles. Thank God. Have a good evening.”

With those parting words, I quickly unlock the door and shut myself in.

Finally, some peace and quiet. I drop all my bags on the entry table and take off my heels. I feel like this respite couldn’t have come even one second later.

Rubbing my slightly aching soles, I turn on the TV to one of the only stations worth watching, in my opinion, LoveWorld XP.

Next stop on the road to getting comfy: I have to get out of these work clothes. Sweatpants and a comfy T-shirt sound more like it. So, I head to my room to change into that.

A loud grumble from my tummy reminds me that I haven’t had anything to eat since lunchtime, 8 hours ago.

At this point, I can’t help but celebrate the genius of whoever came up with the idea of instant noodles. Imagine having to cook in a moment like this, when hunger is already making your stomach grumble every 15 seconds. To the kitchen I go, quickly preparing two packets of my favourite noodles.

Minutes later, I am comfortably situated on my couch, tucked under my favourite duvet. I dig into my perfect bowl of noodles while watching LoveWorld Expressions to catch the latest music video. A notification pops up on my phone.

“Big Sis ♥️♥️♥️,” the text from my little sister reads. I was wondering when this young lady would call me; I haven’t heard from her in days.

I fire off a quick response so I can get back to my food.

“Baby girl, how are you? Called you yesterday but your line was off.”

In true Gen Z fashion, my sister’s response is swift.

“Heeeeey! Only God knows how many other people have tried to reach me and couldn’t. Sis, it’s my phone o. It started misbehaving some days ago. It just goes off when the battery is like 60%. I took it to the phone repair shop and the guys there said the battery is bad.”

“Are you for real? Sorry o, but that your phone has tried shaa, lol.”

“I really don’t know what to do right now because Dad just bought me a new laptop 2 weeks ago, and I can’t start telling him that my phone is bad.”

“You’re right. He will tell you to go and read your books 🤣.”

“Sis, that’s why I have you now, the best big sis in the whole world. Pretty please, Sis…I need a new phone.”

I honestly cannot believe this day. I drop the forkful of noodles I was about to eat. My appetite is completely gone at this point.

Minutes pass, and I’m fully aware that I haven’t responded. But right now, it all feels too much. First it was the \$700 demand at work, then the reminder about my Messenger Angel Book pledge, then the unexpected plea for help from Charles, now my sister. What’s next?

Another text comes in with a loud ping. I know my sister is probably wondering why my response is taking so long. She has no idea what this adulting business entails.

Reluctantly, I open the text. Whatever she has to say will probably leave me with no choice but to fulfill my role as the deputy parent.

“Okay, Sis, please just give me money to repair the phone…I’m really desperate. You know I’m in my final year, and I really need a phone to communicate with all these lecturers. You’re my only hope right now 🙏🏾.”

A deep sigh involuntarily escapes me. How can I not help? My sister needs me. I will have to find a way to make it work.

“No problem, girl, what are elder sisters for? Send me the cost of buying a new phone vs repairing the phone. I will weigh the pros and cons and send you the money for whichever option I decide on.”

My sister’s reply is immediate, lest I even think about changing my mind.

“I love you with all my heart, Big Sis ❤️😘
You are simply the best.”

Yeah, yeah. I wonder if she would still say that if I had said I couldn’t help. Anyways, it is well.

I look at the TV, seeing the end credits of the show rolling out but not registering anything I’m seeing. My mind is full. I head to the kitchen and trash the leftover cold noodles. So much for a relaxing night with a little entertainment for distraction.

Suddenly it hits me—what am I actually going to do? What’s in my account is not so much. I wish there was someone I could call right now to help me with some funds.

Almost immediately, a direct response to my worrisome train of thought wells up in my heart: “…that you may always and under all circumstances and whatever the need be self-sufficient (possessing enough to require no aid or support and furnished in abundance for every good work and charitable donation).”

Wow, where did this thought come from? Yeah, that’s true though.

Again, the same sweet and soft but clear voice whispers to me: “…If I will not open to you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.”

That’s right! I paid the tenth last week, so this is my lot!

Energy surges in immediately.

Unknown tongues are uttered.

Hagar is going on.

More words like the precious ones from before are pouring out.

Soon, there is a roaring.

Soon, there’s a note of victory. There’s a knowing that I just lambanoed.

What a way to end the day! Now I can enjoy my sleep, knowing fully well that I have nothing to worry about. I’m just going to prepare my work clothes for tomorrow so it won’t take up my time in the morning.

I run my mind through my closet and decide to wear my beige dress with the fringe bottom. But that means I would have to change the blue bag I was carrying today to a beige one, to avoid being a walking fashion disaster.

I head to my bag closet and pull out the beige bag I had in mind. I start transferring things from my blue bag into it.

As I am placing my cards in the side pocket of my beige bag, my hand brushes against some paper-like items—a bundle of notes, it seems.

Wondering what long-forgotten notes it could be, I pull out the items from the bag. It’s then I realise it’s not a bundle of old notes—it’s money. An actual bundle of money. How did this get here? I don’t recall putting it here. I sit on my bed, absolutely stunned. I am trying to remember possibly keeping such an amount away, but nothing is coming to mind.

Could it really be? Who put the money in my bag? Honestly, I need to stop asking unnecessary questions and count the money. It’s exactly the amount I had been wishing I could ask someone for moments ago.

“It works!” I dance and jump all around my room. When I finally calm down, I place the money in my wallet and finish the rest of my preparations for work.

I make sure my dress is ironed and hung, my shoes are polished, and my lunch for tomorrow is prepped. Now, it’s time to call it a day.

I reach for my phone to set an alarm, and a notification pops up from my bank.

These banks, don’t they sleep? Which charge have they collected again?

Wait a minute…is this real?

I sit up…

It’s a credit alert with several zeros!

Another message pops up just as I’m coming to terms with the credit alert I’ve just seen!

“Hey Vee, how are you? I’ve been meaning to do this, and tonight I just felt I shouldn’t let it pass today. Just a little something to say thank you for housing me for a month last year when I had house issues. You are special.”

Okay!!!!! This is what I’m talking about! Wowwwwww, I’m loving this life mehn!!!!

The life of a Sealed One!
